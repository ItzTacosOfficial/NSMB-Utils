# NSMB Utils
NSMB Utils it's an ASM hack for NSMB that includes a Cheat Menu, an Address Viewer and a Ram Viewer.
For now this menu can be only used in the level scene.
## How to open it
To open the menu just press [start] while in a level to open the pause menu, and then press [select] to initialize the NSMB Utils's menu.
The specific controls for the menu are shown in the bottom part of the bottom screen.
The Utils menu will close every time you resume the level, except when you are using the Address Viewer or the Ram Viewer.
Unfortunatly the options in the pause menu are disabled to avoid some graphical glitches.
## The cheat menu
In the cheat menu at the moment there are 10 cheats, for each cheat there is an info in the menu.
The cheats are:
* Fly
* Random Animation
* Powerup Cycle
* Slow Fall
* Starman Switch
* Kill Switch
* Fireball Abuse
* Fast Move
* Wall Clip
* Size Changer
## The address viewer
Here you can add multiple addresses with a max of 14 to see their values directly while playing.
The addresses must be in a range of 0x03810000 - 0x01ff8000
## The ram viewer
As the name says, here you can see ram values in 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit.
Like the address viewer, the address must be in the same range (0x03810000 - 0x01ff8000)
